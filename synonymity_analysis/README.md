The pipeline and scripts here constitute a secondary analysis pipeline based on the output of the primary pipeline circleseq. This pipeline takes a genome annotation file (gff) and an uncompressed vcf header representing the species of interest (can be generated by coercing to vcf output with a bam from the primary pipeline and copying the header), along with a pileup (variants.txt) from the circleseq pipeline output to evaluate the distribution and effect of somatic mutations across individual genes and entire gene ontology sets.

Has the additional dependencies of the external software SnpEff (http://snpeff.sourceforge.net/) and the python package GFFUtils (0.10 or greater). 

To use, first edit the Snakefile config section (at the top) to reflect your system layout, then type into the shell:

snakemake {sample_name}_genemut.txt

Where sample name is the prefix for the variants file (e.g. {sample_name}_variants.txt). 

Graphs can be produced by calling "python3 visualize_synonymity.py" on the resulting custom output text file.
